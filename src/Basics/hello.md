# Hello, World!

The "Hello, World!" program is a classic first program for anyone learning a new language. In Ysh, it's as simple as it gets.

Create a file named `hello.ysh` with the following content:

```ysh
echo "Hello, World!"
```

To run this script, you can use the `ysh` interpreter:

```sh
ysh hello.ysh
```

This will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
